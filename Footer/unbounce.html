A Note From Trey:

Hi everyone,
I hope all of you are safe and well!
For this week’s Dinner And A Movie we thought it would be thrilling to invite Scott Tacinelli and Angie Rito of Don Angie to design a menu. Don Angie is regarded as one of the top restaurants in NYC today, and we had an unforgettable dinner there with friends a few months ago. Scott and Angie are long time members of the Phish community, having attended many shows, and we all sat and talked and laughed at the table after dinner and had such a fun night. We are so grateful to them for sharing their culinary wizardry with all of you this week. Of course we all look forward to a day when NYC restaurants are open, as well as all the incredible music venues. For Dinner and a Movie this week, we can have a taste.

Italian American Stuffed Peppers
Makes 5 to 8 peppers

For the filling:
    - 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
    - 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic
    - 2 teaspoon kosher salt
    - 2 anchovies, finely chopped
    - ¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
    - 1 teaspoon dried oregano
    - ½ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
    - ½ cup ricotta
    - ½ cup grated pecorino
    - ½ cup grated parmesan
    - 1/3 cup seeded and chopped sweet pickled cherry peppers (such as B&G brand)
    - 2 tablespoons roughly chopped parsley, plus 1 tablespoon for garnish
    - 1 egg

To assemble:
    - 5-8 Italian frying peppers (aka Cubanelles)
    - 2 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
    - 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice

Preheat oven to 400°F. In a saute pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add in garlic and salt and cook until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Add in anchovies, pepper, and oregano and cook another minute longer. Remove from heat and set aside. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked garlic mixture with bread crumbs, ricotta, pecorino, parmesan, chopped cherry peppers, 2 tablespoons parsley, and egg by hand until well incorporated.

Using a small knife, cut the top of the pepper off just below the stem. With your finger or a small spoon, remove as much of the seeds and ribs that you can without breaking the pepper. Using your fingers, carefully push the stuffing mixture into the pepper, pushing gently to get it all the way to the end of the pepper. Repeat with all peppers.

In a medium heavy-bottomed saute pan or cast iron skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat. Add the peppers and cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Add ¼ cup of water to the pan or skillet along with the lemon juice. Place in the oven and bake until peppers are completely soft and cooked through, and the filling is slightly crispy on exposed parts, about 15 minutes. Top with remaining chopped 1 tablespoon chopped parsley and olive oil and serve immediately.

Pasta e Fagioli with Black Eyed Peas & Collard Greens
Makes about 10 cups, serves 6 to 8

     - ¼ pound thinly sliced prosciutto, chopped finely (optional)
     - 1 cup extra virgin olive oil
     - ½ bunch collard greens (about 9 leaves)
     - 6 scallions, sliced thinly, whites and greens separated
     - 7 garlic cloves, chopped finely
     - 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
     - 2 tablespoons kosher salt
     - 1 ½ teaspoon fresh ground black pepper
     - Zest of one lemon
     - ¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
     - 1 1/2 cups cooked black eyed peas or 1 1/2 cups canned (from one 15.5-ounce can), drained and rinsed
     - 8 cups no-sodium chicken stock
     - 1 ½ cups uncooked ditalini pasta
     - Pinch of sugar
     - ¾ cup grated parmesan, plus ¼ cup for topping

Remove the inner stem from collards and discard. Roll the leaves into a tube and chop them into 2-inch strips. Set aside.

In a large pot over medium heat, combine olive oil and prosciutto, if using. Cook until the prosciutto is slightly fried and its fat has rendered, about 3 minutes. (If not using prosciutto, skip this step.) Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Stir well to combine. Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the scallion whites and cook until they have wilted, about 2 minutes.

Add the collard greens, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Continue cooking over medium heat, stirring often, until greens are wilted, 12 to 15 minutes. Add the beans and stock. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes, then add the pasta. Cook until pasta is soft, about 8 minutes.

Stir in sugar, scallion greens, and ¾ cup parmesan and serve immediately, topping with the remaining cheese.

Polenta Snickerdoodle Cookies
Makes about 12-14 cookies

    - 1 cup (½ pound) unsalted butter, at room temperature
    - 1 ½ cups plus 1/2 cup sugar
    - 2 eggs
    - 2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract
    - 2 teaspoons kosher salt
    - 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
    - 1¼ cup plus 1 tablespoon instant polenta
    - 1 ½ teaspoon cream of tartar
    - ½ teaspoon baking soda
    - 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon
    - ¼ teaspoon cayenne

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine the butter and 1 1/2 cups of the sugar. Mix on medium-high until light and fluffy, 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl, then add the eggs and vanilla and mix on medium-high for 2 more minutes. Add the salt, flour, polenta, cream of tartar and baking soda and mix briefly to combine. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

Heat oven to 350°F. In a small bowl, mix remaining 1/2 cup of sugar, cinnamon and cayenne. Remove the cookie dough from the refrigerator and, using your hands, roll it into 1 1/2 inch sized balls (about 2 tablespoons). One by one, roll each ball in the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (or a silicone mat) sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and place 6-7 cookies on each, leaving lots of room between them. Gently press down on each cookie with the palm of your hand to flatten them.

Bake until just golden brown around the edges, 10-12 minutes. Allow to cool before serving.
